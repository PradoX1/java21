    <p>Hey, I’m Dan! Obsessed with exploring the <br>world, meeting new people and getting as <br> lost as possible with
        my camera. I was on the <br> road full-time between 2014 – 2018, taking a <br> chance on changing my career from
        <br>restaurant manager to capturing the world <br>and somehow it all worked out… Now, I’m <br> starting a new
        chapter in Portugal, and <br>blogging here as well as writing guidebooks <br>and articles for other
        publications. <br>


        I hope this site and some of my favourite <br> trips, places, and people give you inspiration <br> (and handy
        tips) to go and chase your own <br> adventures – even if it’s just outside your <br> own doorstep! <a

        <h4>HEY, I’M DAN…</h4>
        <p>
            ...and I'm obsessed with getting lost in new places and meeting new faces. <br> From remote Atlantic Islands
            full of Penguins, to bustling Italian cities <br> crammed with amazing architecture. I've been lucky enough
            to turn my <br> passion for travel and photography into my job, and spent four years travelling <br> full
            time before settling down in Portugal - a far cry from the life I thought I <br> would have when I left my
            London restaurant managers job. This website is <br> full of my favourite places and people, and stories
            from the road - I hope it can <br> help you explore the world a little bit better through tips, advice, and
            personal <br> stories. Safe travels!
